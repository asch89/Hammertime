# Hammertime
 Hammertime is a endless-runner style game I built with C# in the Unity Game Engine. The player must defeat waves of enemies amid randomly generated obstacles. The player moves left and right with the A and D keys and can swing a hammer to defeat enemies using the mouse. Time was dedicated to tweaking the physics settings to make swinging through enemies and obstacles as satisfying as possible. Unique challenges in this project were endlessly generating new waves, cleanup of previous waves, getting the physics just right, and translating the position of the hammer in 3D space to the position of the mouse in 2D space (the screen).
